### Initialsing a Journey

To start, the calling service must make a **POST** to `/internal/initialise-journey`

The **POST** will contain a **json** body as config for setting up the journey. The **json** consists of one item, a **redirect url** which is used by this service to redirect the user back to the calling service once they have confirmed their sic codes.

The **POST Json** should look like:
```json
{
  "redirectUrl":"return-url-here"
}
```

From this **POST**, the calling service will receive back an **Ok** response if initialisation was successful.

If the response code received is a **BadRequest**, the error message can be seen in the **body** of the response.

Within the body of the **Ok** response is a **json** body which contains a url that the calling service can redirect to, in order to begin the journey, and also a url which can be used by the calling service to fetch the sic code choices the user has made.

The **Ok** response will look like:
```json
{
  "journeyStartUri":"/sic-search/UUID/search-standard-industry-classification-codes",
  "fetchResultsUri":"/internal/UUID/fetch-results"
}
```

### Receiving selected sic codes

Once the user has left the service and redirected back to the calling service via the provided redirect url, the calling service can make a **GET** request to the **fetchResultsUri** and a json body will be returned with the results of the journey.

The responses that can be recieved from the **GET** can be:

* **Ok** - contains json body of sic code results (see below)
* **BadRequest** - error message can be found in the body of the response
* **NotFound** - initialisation was not done or no sic codes have been selected

The **GET Ok** response json body will look like:
```json
{
  "sicCodes":[
    {
      "code":"12345",
      "desc":"description of code",
      "indexes":[
        "index",
        "index"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The indexes list in the json can be empty on the **GET**
